            <h3>Heavy Equipment Moving</h3>
            <p>Moving manufacturing equipment in Seattle's industrial neighborhoods requires specialized expertise. Whether you're relocating a stamping press in Georgetown, installing CNC machines in Renton, or moving production equipment in SODO, our rigging teams have the experience and equipment to handle it safely. We navigate tight spaces, work around active production, and minimize downtime—critical factors for Seattle manufacturers operating in competitive markets.</p>
            
            <h3>Crane Services</h3>
            <p>Seattle crane services from PNW Rigging Solutions include mobile cranes from 3 to 500 tons operated by NCCCO-certified professionals. We handle rooftop HVAC installations in downtown high-rises, structural steel erection at new construction sites, equipment placement in existing facilities, and emergency breakdown response across the metro area. Our operators know Seattle's streets, understand permit requirements, and can navigate the logistical challenges of urban crane work.</p>
            
            <h3>Structural Steel Rigging</h3>
            <p>Seattle's metal fabrication shops produce everything from architectural steel to heavy structural components. Our structural steel rigging services include material handling in fabrication shops, loading and unloading steel shipments, positioning beams and plates for welding and cutting, and supporting fabrication operations with safe, efficient steel movement.</p>
            
            <h3>Plant Maintenance & Shutdown Support</h3>
            <p>When Seattle manufacturers schedule maintenance shutdowns or equipment upgrades, downtime costs money. Our rigging crews specialize in rapid equipment removal and installation during planned shutdowns. We pre-plan every move, stage replacement equipment, and work efficiently to get your facility back in production quickly.</p>
            
            <h3>Load Engineering & Lift Planning</h3>
            <p>Complex rigging projects require engineering analysis.

            <h3>Aerospace Component Fabrication Facility - Renton</h3>
            <p>Relocated six large CNC machining centers for a tier-one aerospace supplier during a planned facility expansion. Project required coordination with active production schedules, strict FOD control, precision alignment to 0.0005" tolerances, and compressed timeline during a two-week shutdown. All machines operational on schedule with zero quality issues.</p>
            
            <h3>Metal Fabrication Shop Expansion - Georgetown</h3>
            <p>Moved 40-ton press brake and multiple fabrication machines from a closing facility to an expanding Georgetown shop. Challenges included narrow streets requiring traffic control, building with limited floor load capacity requiring reinforcement assessment, and weekend timing to avoid disrupting either location's production. Completed on time with all equipment calibrated and operational.</p>
            
            <h3>Craft Brewery Equipment Installation - Ballard</h3>
            <p>Rigged and installed fermentation tanks, brewing kettles, and process equipment for an expanding craft brewery.
