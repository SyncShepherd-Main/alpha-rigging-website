            <h2>Expert Crane Services for Industrial Applications</h2>
            <p>When your project requires professional lifting capabilities, PNW Rigging Solutions provides comprehensive crane services across Washington State. Our fleet of mobile cranes from 3 to 500 tons, operated by NCCCO-certified professionals, delivers the precision, safety, and reliability that complex industrial lifts demand.</p>
            
            <p>Whether you're setting HVAC units on rooftops, positioning steel beams during construction, installing manufacturing equipment, or handling emergency breakdown situations, our crane services provide the capacity, expertise, and safety protocols that protect your people, your property, and your timeline.</p>
            
            <h2>Our Crane Fleet</h2>
            <p>We maintain a diverse fleet of hydraulic and lattice boom cranes to handle any lifting application:</p>
            
            <p><strong>All-Terrain Cranes (20-500 tons):</strong> These versatile cranes combine highway mobility with off-road capability. With multiple axles, four-wheel drive, and excellent ground clearance, they navigate job sites that would stop conventional cranes. Our AT cranes are ideal for construction sites, industrial facilities, and projects requiring both mobility and substantial capacity.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Rough Terrain Cranes (15-100 tons):</strong> Purpose-built for off-highway operation, these cranes excel in tight industrial environments. With their compact footprint, excellent maneuverability, and outriggers that stabilize on uneven ground, RT cranes are perfect for plant maintenance, equipment installation, and jobs where space is limited.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Truck-Mounted Cranes (3-50 tons):</strong> For smaller lifts and quick mobilization, our truck cranes provide cost-effective solutions. These units set up quickly, require minimal space, and handle routine lifting tasks efficiently. Ideal for HVAC installation, sign erection, and light structural work.</p>
            
            <h2>Crane Service Applications</h2>
            <p>Our crane services support diverse industries and applications throughout Washington:</p>
            
            <p><strong>Manufacturing & Industrial:</strong> Equipment installation and removal, plant maintenance shutdowns, component replacement, die changes, machinery positioning</p>
            
            <p><strong>Construction:</strong> Structural steel erection, precast concrete placement, tilt-up wall panel installation, roofing material placement, HVAC and mechanical equipment installation</p>

            <h2>NCCCO Certified Operators</h2>
            <p>Every crane we deploy is operated by personnel certified through the National Commission for the Certification of Crane Operators (NCCCO)—the industry's gold standard for operator qualification. Our operators maintain:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Current NCCCO certification for their specific crane type and capacity range</li>
                <li>Annual recertification and continuing education requirements</li>
                <li>Daily equipment inspection protocols per OSHA 1926.1412</li>
                <li>Documented experience with complex lifts and challenging conditions</li>
                <li>Excellent safety records with zero preventable incidents</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Beyond certification, our operators bring judgment, experience, and problem-solving abilities that only years of field work can develop. They recognize potential hazards, anticipate challenges, and make the split-second decisions that ensure safe, successful lifts.</p>
            
            <h2>Pre-Lift Planning & Engineering</h2>
            <p>Complex lifts require more than capacity—they demand engineering analysis and detailed planning. For projects involving critical lifts, unusual configurations, or challenging conditions, we provide comprehensive pre-lift planning services:</p>
            
            <p><strong>Load Analysis:</strong> We calculate actual load weights (including rigging), determine center of gravity, account for dynamic loads during lifting, and verify crane capacity at required radius with appropriate safety factors.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Site Assessment:</strong> Our team evaluates ground conditions and load-bearing capacity, identifies overhead obstructions (power lines, structures), determines crane positioning and outrigger placement, and verifies adequate clearances for boom movement.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Lift Plan Development:</strong> We create documented lift plans showing crane placement, load path, rigging configuration, critical radii and boom angles, and emergency procedures. For critical lifts, we conduct pre-lift meetings with all personnel.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Permits & Notifications:</strong> We handle crane operating permits where required, coordinate utility notifications for work near power lines, arrange for road closures or lane restrictions if needed, and ensure all regulatory requirements are met.</p>

            </div>
            
            <h2>Safety: Our Core Value</h2>
            <p>Crane operations involve substantial risks—overhead loads, complex rigging, proximity to workers and structures. We address these risks through systematic safety protocols:</p>
            
            <p><strong>Equipment Inspection:</strong> Every crane undergoes daily pre-operational inspection per OSHA requirements, monthly detailed inspections documented in maintenance logs, annual third-party certification, and immediate removal from service if deficiencies are identified.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Operational Procedures:</strong> We establish and maintain exclusion zones around operating cranes, implement tag line control for load stability, use spotters for obstructed views or tight clearances, maintain constant communication via hand signals or two-way radio, and monitor wind speeds with immediate shutdown if limits are exceeded.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Site Safety:</strong> Before beginning operations, we identify and barricade overhead power lines, verify ground conditions can support crane outriggers, establish clear communication protocols with site personnel, conduct safety briefings with all workers in the area, and maintain emergency response plans.</p>
            
            <h2>Crane Rental vs. Operated Service</h2>
            <p>We offer both bare crane rental and fully operated crane services:</p>
            
            <p><strong>Operated Crane Service (Recommended):</strong> Our operator, our crane, our responsibility. This full-service option includes NCCCO certified operator, daily equipment inspection, all rigging hardware, pre-lift planning assistance, insurance coverage, and complete safety management. This is our most popular option and provides the best value for most customers.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Bare Crane Rental (Qualified Customers Only):</strong> For customers with their own certified operators and rigging expertise, we offer bare crane rental. Requirements include proof of operator NCCCO certification, verification of rigging qualifications, appropriate insurance coverage, and documented safety programs. Customer assumes full operational responsibility.</p>
            
            <h2>Crane Service Pricing</h2>
            <p>Crane service costs depend on several factors:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Crane Size & Type:</strong> Capacity requirements, boom length needed, terrain capabilities</li>
                <li><strong>Duration:</strong> Hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly rates available</li>
                <li><strong>Mobilization:</strong> Distance to job site, transport requirements for larger cranes</li>
                <li><strong>Operator Requirements:</strong> Standard hours vs. overtime or weekend work</li>
                <li><strong>Site Conditions:</strong> Normal vs. challenging access or ground conditions</li>
                <li><strong>Lift Complexity:</strong> Routine lifts vs. engineered critical lifts requiring planning</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>We provide transparent, detailed quotes that include all costs—crane rental, operator, mobilization, and any special requirements. Most customers find operated crane service more cost-effective than managing bare rental when all factors are considered.</p>
            
            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            
            <p><strong>Q: How do I know what size crane I need?</strong><br>
            A: Our estimators help determine appropriate crane size based on load weight, lift height, and required radius. Generally, heavier loads, higher lifts, and greater distances from crane require larger capacity. We'll review your project and recommend the right crane.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Q: Can you operate near power lines?</strong><br>
            A: Yes, with proper precautions. OSHA requires minimum clearance distances from energized lines (typically 20 feet for lines up to 50kV). For closer work, we coordinate with utilities to de-energize lines or install protective barriers. Power line safety is a critical part of our pre-job planning.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Q: What ground conditions can support crane operations?</strong><br>
            A: Most cranes can operate on reasonably firm, level ground. We use outrigger pads to distribute loads and can work on asphalt, concrete, compacted gravel, or stable soil. Soft ground, steep slopes, or underground utilities may require special preparations like timber mats or engineered pads.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Q: Do you provide rigging as part of crane service?</strong><br>
            A: Yes. Operated crane service includes standard rigging hardware (slings, shackles, hooks) appropriate for the lift. Specialized rigging (spreader bars, custom attachments) is available and priced separately when needed.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Q: How far in advance should we schedule crane service?</strong><br>
            A: For routine lifts, 1-2 weeks notice ensures equipment availability. For specific crane types or peak construction season, 2-4 weeks is better. Emergency response is available 24/7 with typical mobilization within 4-8 hours.</p>
