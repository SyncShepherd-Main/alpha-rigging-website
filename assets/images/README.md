     alt="50-ton mobile crane performing industrial lift in Seattle" 
     loading="lazy"
     width="800" 
     height="600">
```

## Priority

1. **Homepage hero image** - Large, impressive shot of equipment/project
2. **Service page images** - Show specific services being performed
3. **Location page images** - Local projects if available
4. **Team photos** - Build trust and personality
5. **Equipment photos** - Show your capabilities

Upload images before launching to maximize impact and professionalism.
