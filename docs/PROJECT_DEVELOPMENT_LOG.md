## Design & Layout Changes

### Hero Section Optimization

**Initial State:**
- Full viewport height (`min-height: 100vh`)
- Excessive white space
- Not aligned with modern industrial design trends

**Changes Made:**
1. **Height Reduction**
   - Changed from `min-height: 100vh` to `padding: 80px 40px`
   - Reduced mobile padding to `40px 20px`
   - More compact, professional appearance
   - Matches industry standard templates (g54, g62 reference)

2. **Full-Width Implementation**
   - Identified global `section` rule constraining width to 1400px
   - Added `:not()` selectors to exclude hero from global constraint
   - Applied `max-width: none` and `margin: 0` overrides
   - Hero now extends edge-to-edge with centered content at 1400px

**Code Changes:**
```css
/* Before */
.hero {
    min-height: 100vh;
    max-width: 1400px;
    margin: 0 auto;
}

/* After */
.hero {
    padding: 80px 40px;
    width: 100%;
    max-width: none;
    margin: 0;
}

.hero-content {
    max-width: 1400px;
    margin: 0 auto;
}

section:not(.hero):not(.cta-section):not(.contact-section):not(.why-us-section) {
    padding: 100px 40px;
    max-width: 1400px;
    margin: 0 auto;
}
```

---

### Stats Bar Full-Width

**Purpose:** Orange stats bar spanning full viewport width

**Implementation:**
```css
.stats-bar {
    background: var(--primary-orange);
    width: 100%;
    max-width: none;
    padding: 40px;
}
```

---

### "Why Choose Us" Section Full-Width

**Purpose:** Gray background section spanning full width with contained content

**Implementation:**
1. Created `.why-us-section` class
2. Excluded from global section constraint
3. Added centered content containers

```css
.why-us-section {
    background: var(--concrete-gray);
    padding: 100px 40px;
}

.why-us-section .section-header,
.why-us-section .features-grid {
    max-width: 1400px;
    margin-left: auto;

    .stats-bar { grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr); }
}
