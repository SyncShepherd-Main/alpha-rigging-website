## BATCH CREATION SCRIPT

You can use this approach with Claude Code or other automation tools:

```python
# Example pseudo-code for batch generation

cities = [
    {"name": "Tacoma", "phone": "253-555-0100", "industries": ["port", "maritime", "manufacturing"]},
    {"name": "Spokane", "phone": "509-555-0100", "industries": ["aerospace", "food processing"]},
    # etc.
]

services = [
    {"name": "Structural Steel Rigging", "keyword": "structural steel rigging"},
    {"name": "Plant Maintenance Support", "keyword": "plant maintenance rigging"},
    # etc.
]

for city in cities:
    generate_location_page(city, template, content_sections)
    
for service in services:
    generate_service_page(service, template, content_sections)
```

---

## QUALITY CONTROL CHECKLIST

Before finalizing each page:
